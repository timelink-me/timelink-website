# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Development:**
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production with Turbopack
- `npm run export` - Build and export static files
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Project Architecture

This is a Next.js 15 project using the App Router pattern, configured for static export with SSG. The application is a marketing website for TimeLink, a timeline creation tool.

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Static Export Configuration:**
- Configured in `next.config.ts` with `output: 'export'` and `trailingSlash: true`
- Images are unoptimized for static hosting compatibility
- Build outputs to `/out` directory

**Multi-language Support:**
- `LanguageContext` provides translation functionality via React Context
- Translations stored in `src/lib/translations.ts` supporting English and Chinese
- Uses `useLanguage()` hook to access current language and translations

**Theme System:**
- `ThemeContext` implements light/dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence
- Automatically detects system theme preference on first visit
- Uses Tailwind CSS dark mode classes

**Component Structure:**
- Page components in `src/app/` (App Router)
- Reusable components in `src/components/`
- Context providers in `src/contexts/`
- Utilities and translations in `src/lib/`

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Fonts:** Geist Sans and Geist Mono (Google Fonts)
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled with path aliases (`@/*` â†’ `./src/*`)

### Context Providers

The app is wrapped with nested providers in `layout.tsx`:
1. `ThemeProvider` - Manages light/dark theme state
2. `LanguageProvider` - Manages translation state and current language

Both contexts must be used within their respective providers and will throw errors if used outside.
